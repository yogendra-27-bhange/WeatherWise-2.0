# **App Name**: Weatherwise 2.0

## Core Features:

- Clothing Suggestion: Suggest appropriate clothing based on the current weather conditions (e.g., raincoat for rain, light cotton wear for summer, woolen jacket for winter).
- Food Suggestion: Suggest season-appropriate food and drinks based on the current weather (e.g., soup and chai for cold weather, juices and ice cream for hot weather).
